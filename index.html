            <div class="w3-col m6 w3-left w3-padding-large">
                <p>Adapted from the Duelingdata, which examines the language of the three key surviving characters, Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister, and Jon Snow; from each chapter in the five Game of Thrones novels to illustrate which terms in the novels are unique to each character by frequency</p>
                <p class="w3-wide mg">Data:</p>
                <P>The frequency of usage has been evaluated to discover that each word is unique based on the number of times it has been used by each character in this example. The selection of "uniqueness" is incredibly baffling, and it is difficult to perceive the visualization since, although being put at the same distance from the center and in a comparable ratio, certain words are designated as common terms while others are not, making understanding difficult.</P>
                <p class="w3-wide">Idiom:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is an excellent use of gradients and size as a channel in the design to indicate which word belongs to them and how frequently they used it, but the abrupt transition from white to color makes it difficult to comprehend how the transcoded work was achieved.</li>
                    <li>There is a glaring omission of an explanation for why certain words are hatched while others are not. Are these more unusual in comparison to those of similar size in the vicinity of those hatched?</li>
                </ul>   
                <p class="w3-wide">Suggestion:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It would be easier to comprehend the present visualization if the graphic was more dynamic and just displayed one relationship at a time.</li>
                    <li>To acquire further understanding and information, a Bloom Diagram with three overlapping levels would be better to the existing one.</li>

                <p>Here's a visual representation of how much data is collected every minute of the day, taken from a Forbes article by Nicole Martin and published on August 7th, 2019. The figure primarily depicts two major variables: the data source and the quantity of data generated by the source.</p>
                <p class="w3-wide mg">Data:</p>
                <P>In the first place, there is a lack of organizational structure in the data, as all are packaged as each category, despite the fact that they may be classified by activities; second, there is overlap in the data, such the hashtag #love was treated as a single category and not expressly specified whether it is omitted or still retained from the primary data producers such as Instagram or Twitter.</P>
                <p class="w3-wide">Idiom:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The graph employs a radial arrangement to explain; however, each segment and the use of color do not reflect any data values and instead serve just as a visual divider of each category, making it more confusing by offering no organizational structure or visualization methodologies.</li>
                    <li>The reader is left to wonder what this means for them as a consumer, and why they should care about it at this point in time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="w3-wide">Suggestion:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regrouping the data according to the data source and visualizing it in a bar chart or mekko chart will at the very least provide context for the data.</li>
                    <li>If the bars or mekko's boxes are made clickable, the viewer may observe the data divide into its several subcategories, resolving the issue of data overlap.</li>
